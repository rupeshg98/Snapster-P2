			interact with it without purging the database. It will update any entities 
			within our database that are not consistent with our mapped Java models. 
			create-drop: Hibernate creates all of the tables and then drops them when 
			the application stops running. This is good for testing purposes but not 
			ideal in production. validate: Hibernate will validate a pre-existing schema. 
			This means that it will make sure that your Java models are mapped in a way 
			that is consistent with the existing schema. -->
